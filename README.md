# Anemia Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is designed to detect anemia in patients using a machine learning model. By analyzing patient data, the model can predict whether a patient is anemic. The key steps in the project include data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future use.

## Key Features

- **Data Loading**: The patient data is loaded from a CSV file.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Model Training**: Uses a Random Forest Classifier to train the model on the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy and classification report metrics.
- **Model Saving**: Saves the trained model and scaler for future predictions.

This project demonstrates the complete workflow of building a machine learning model for medical diagnosis, focusing on anemia detection.
